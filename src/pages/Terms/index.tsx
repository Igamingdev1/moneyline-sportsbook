                Limits - in order to assist our players in gambling responsibly,
                we have a limit option within each customer account. This option
                is offered to you straight after sign up in a pop-up message.
                The Limits can later be accessed or/and changed through the
                Settings section - Responsible Gambling in your Profile page
                (click “ADD LIMITS”) These limits allow you to set the maximum
                amount of money you will be able to deposit (Maximum Deposit),
                wager (Maximum Wager), or lose (Maximum Loss). You will also be
                able to choose the time period for which each of the above

                will take effect immediately, but an increase can only occur
                after a twenty-four (24) hours cooling-off period during which
                the previous limit shall remain in force, in order to avoid rash
                decisions. If you require any further information or assistance
                regarding limits’ functionality, please contact our customer
                support.
